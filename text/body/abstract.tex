Phylogenetic analyses represent a promising tool for drawing inferences from digital evolution experiments at scale. Here, we expand on this promise in multiple ways: 1) we begin the process of identifying how the signatures of various evolutionary dynamics manifest in phylogenetic metrics, 2) we present an improved technique for reconstructing phylogenies from tunably-precise genome annotations, 3) we quantify
