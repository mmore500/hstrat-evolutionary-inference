### Response to Reviewer 1

**Comment:**  
*My request for this paper is to add a section clarifying the differences between this paper and the previous one.
(If my understanding is correct, the result of the simple model is the same from the previous one, but one of the phylometric ("ancestor count") is replaced to the different one ("sum pairwise distance").)*

**Response:**  
Thank you for highlighting the need to clarify the differences between our current work and previous publications.
We have added a paragraph in the Introduction section that explicitly outlines how this manuscript extends our prior research.
Specifically, we discuss the integration of Avida and Gen3sis into our analysis and the refinement of the set of phylogeny metrics employed.

The added text is as follows:

 However, for \textit{in vivo} systems perfect phylogeny tracking is not typicall
 Moreover, as digital evolution systems scale, issues of data loss and centralization overhead make perfect tracking at best inefficient and at worst untenable.
 Thus, some systems will likely need to adopt a decentralized, reconstruction-based approach similar to biological data \citep{moreno2024analysis}, which can be achieved through the recently-developed ``hereditary stratigraphy'' methodology \citep{moreno2022hstrat}.
 
-Effective use of phylogenetic metrics in scenarios where exact phylogenies are not available requires understanding of potential confounding effects from inaccuracies introduced by reconstruction.
-However, it is in precisely such scenarios where the new capabilities to characterize evolutionary dynamics could have the largest impact; large-scale systems can produce an intractable quantity of data, making phylometrics valuable as summary statistics of the evolutionary process \citep{dolson2020interpreting}.
-In particular, methods are needed to handle large-scale artificial life systems where complete, perfect visibility is not feasible and evolution operates according to implicit, contextually-dependent fitness dynamics \citep{moreno2022exploring,kojima2023implementation}.
-Thus, an additional goal of this paper is to quantify the magnitude and character of bias that reconstruction error introduces.
-In particular, we calculate phylometric metrics across range of reconstruction accuracy levels, and report the level of accuracy necessary to attain metric readings statistically indistinguishable from ground truth.

+This work builds on a series of recent studies developing, testing, and applying hereditary stratigraphy methodology since its introduction in \citet{moreno2022hereditary}.
+Implementation of the hereditary stratigraphy algorithms and utilities are provided in the open-source \textit{hstrat} software package, published via the Python Packaging Index \citep{moreno2022hstrat}.
+\citet{moreno2024guide} characterized trade-offs between memory use, inference precision, and inference accuracy across hereditary stratigraphy configurations, providing a foundation for best practices in applying the methodology.
+The present paper focuses on establishing foundations for using herediatry stratigraphy to infer evolutionary dynamics from phylogenetic history.
+Specifically, the work extends a conference paper \citet{moreno2023toward}, by adding (1) replications of experiments in full-fledged evolution simulation frameworks (i.e., Avida and Gen3sis, introduced in Section \ref{sec:methods}) and (2) refining the set of phylogeny metrics employed.
+Findings from present work have facilitated application of hereditary stratigraphy to characterize dynamics in evolution simulations run on the 850,000-core Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine \citep{moreno2024trackable}, which required engineering a simpler and more efficient algorithmic basis for hereditary stratigraphy \citep{moreno2024structured}.
+Although present work considers non-hybridizing phylogenies (i.e., asexual ancestry trees and species trees), methods applying hereditary stratigraphy to sexual populations have been proposed in \citet{moreno2024methods}.
 
 The utility of a model system for experimental evolution hinges on sufficient ability to observe and interpret underlying evolutionary dynamics.
 Benchtop and field-based biological models continue to benefit from ongoing methodological advances that have profoundly increased visibility into genetic, phenotypic, and phylogenetic state \citep{woodworth2017building,blomberg2011measuring,schneider2019past}.

 However, this would require careful accounting for ubiquitous generation of identical fingerprints by chance and is left to future work.

 Previous work with hereditary stratigraphy used UPGMA distance-based reconstruction techniques \citep{moreno2022hereditary}.
-Large-scale reconstructions required for these experiments necessitated development of a more efficient technique that did not require all pairs (i.e., $O(n^2)$ distance comparison.
+Large-scale reconstructions required for these experiments necessitated development of a more efficient technique that did not require all pairs (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$) distance comparison.
To accomplish this, we devised an agglomerative tree building algorithm that works by successively adding leaf organism annotations and percolating them down from the tree root along the tree path of internal nodes consistent with their fingerprint sequence, then affixing them where common ancestry ends.
This new tree-building approach reduced compute time from multiple hours to around 5 minutes in most cases.
Supplementary Listing \ref{lst:build_tree_trie} provides source code with full implementation details, see \citep{moreno2024analysis} for a more detailed discussion.

### Response to Reviewer 2

**Comment 1:**  
*Several publications about this software package by the same authors exist, yet it remains unclear if the results reported here offer any fundamentally new insights or differences.
It should also be clarified at the beginning of the paper that one of the authors has developed the software package, which is available to the public as a Python library.*

**Response:**  
We appreciate your concern regarding the novelty and transparency of our contributions.
To address this, we have added a paragraph in the Introduction that clarifies how this work builds upon and differs from our previous publications.
We also more directly credit the open-source Python library used in this research.
These changes are shown above, in our response to Reviewer 1.

**Comment 2:**  
*The paper does not address whether variations would arise in the generated phylogenetic trees if the simulations were repeated multiple times for each computational model.
Discussing this variation, along with the ecological or spatial effects considered by these three models, is crucial.
The discussion should focus on both the invariant and variable aspects of the phylogenetic trees to provide a comprehensive understanding of the models’ reliability and the robustness of the hereditary stratigraphy algorithm.*

**Response:**  
Our experimental design does include replication to assess variations arising from repeated simulations, as discussed in the section "Methods — Effect-size Analysis."
These effect size analyses, which take into account variability among replicates, are incorporated throughout our results and discussion.

To better communicate this aspect of our work, we have added clarifications to the Methods section emphasizing the role of replication in allowing us to characterize variability:

 This allowed us to test shorter runs of 32,768 and 98,304 generations (through epochs 0 and 2) in addition to the full-length runs (through epoch 7).
 One additional mutation operator was tested to contrast the unit Gaussian distribution: the unit exponential distribution.
 Under this distribution, deleterious mutations are not possible and large-effect mutations are more likely.
