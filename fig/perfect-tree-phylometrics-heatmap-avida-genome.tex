  Tree phylometrics across surveyed evolutionary regimes, calculated on perfect-fidelity simulation phylogenetic records.
  Note that nonparametric effect size normalization caps out to 1.0/-1.0 past the point of complete disbributional nonoverlap.
  For heatmap charts, +'s indicate small, medium, and large effect sizes using the Cliff's delta statistic and *'s indicate statistical significance at $\alpha = 0.05$ via Mann-Whitney U test.
