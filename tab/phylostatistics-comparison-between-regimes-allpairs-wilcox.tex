\providecommand{\thecaption}{
  All-pairs two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank comparisons of phylometrics between surveyed evolutionary regimes.
  Phylometrics were calculated on perfect-fidelity reference trees.
  All-pairs comparisons within each sensitivity analysis condition are provided.
  Sample size $n=50$ for each population.
  Reported $p$ values are not corrected for multiple comparisons.
  Instead, a Bonferoni-corrected significance threshold of $1.49 \times 10^{-4}$ was used.
