\providecommand{\thecaption}{
  Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance tests for nonequivalence of distributions for each phylometric among surveyed evolutionary regimes.
  Phylometrics were calculated on perfect-fidelity reference trees.
  Kruskal-Wallis test results within each sensitivity analysis condition are provided.
  Sample size $n=50$ for each population, with $N=7$ populations (i.e., evolutionary regimes) compared within each sensitivity analysis condition.
