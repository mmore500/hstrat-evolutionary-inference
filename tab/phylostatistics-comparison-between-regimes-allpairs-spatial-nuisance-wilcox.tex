      All-pairs two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank comparisons of phylometrics between surveyed evolutionary regimes with spatial structure (i.e., island count 1,024).
      All-pairs comparisons within each sensitivity analysis condition are provided.
      Sample size $n=50$ for each population.
      Reported $p$ values are not corrected for multiple comparisons.
      Instead, a Bonferoni-corrected significance threshold of $5.26 \times 10^{-4}$ was used.
