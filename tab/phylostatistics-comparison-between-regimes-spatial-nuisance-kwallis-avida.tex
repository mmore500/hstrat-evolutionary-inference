\providecommand{\thecaption}{
  Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance tests for nonequivalence of distributions for each phylometric among surveyed evolutionary regimes with spatial structure (i.
  e., island count 1,024) for Avida experiments.
  Phylometrics were calculated on perfect-fidelity reference trees.
  Kruskal-Wallis test results within each sensitivity analysis condition are provided.
  Sample size $n=30$ for each population, with $N=4$ populations (i.e., evolutionary regimes) compared within each sensitivity analysis condition.
