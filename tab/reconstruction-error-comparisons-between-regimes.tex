    Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance tests for nonequivalence of reconstruction error distributions among surveyed evolutionary regimes.
    Comparisons were performed independently within each sensitivity anlaysis condition and reconstruction fidelities.
    Sample size $n=50$ for each population, with $N=7$ populations (i.e., evolutionary regimes) compared within each sensitivity analysis condition.
