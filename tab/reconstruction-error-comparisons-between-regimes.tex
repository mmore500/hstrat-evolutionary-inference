  \caption{%
    Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance tests for nonequivalence of reconstruction error distributions among surveyed evolutionary regimes.
    Comparisons were performed independently within each sensitivity anlaysis condition and reconstruction fidelities.
    Error reported as both quartet and triplet distance between reconstructed tree and corresponding reference tree.
    Sample size $n=50$ for each population, with $N=7$ populations (i.e., evolutionary regimes) compared within each sensitivity analysis condition.
