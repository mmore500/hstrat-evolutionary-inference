  \caption{%
    Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance tests for nonequivalence of reconstruction error distributions among reconstruction fidelities.
    Comparisons were performed independently within each sensitivity analysis condition and evolutionary regime.
    Error reported as both quartet and triplet distance between reconstructed tree and corresponding reference tree.
    Sample size $n=50$ for each population, with $N=4$ populations (i.e., reconstruction fidelities) compared within each sensitivity analysis condition.
