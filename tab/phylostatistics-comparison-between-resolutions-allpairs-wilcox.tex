\providecommand{\thecaption}{
  Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank comparisons between phylometric distributions for reconstructed trees and corresponding perfect-fidelity reference trees.
  Comparisons were performed separately for each surveyed reconstruction fidelity, evolutionary regime, and phylometric.
  Sample size $n=50$ for each population.
  Reported $p$ values are not corrected for multiple comparisons, in order to conservatively detect possible phylometric bias from reconstruction error.
